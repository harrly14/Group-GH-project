# About Me
My name is Benedict and I am a first year computer science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I grew up in Florida, but have lived in Denver for two years now. My two main interests in computer science right now are quantum computing and robotics. Outside of computer science, I am interested in astrophysics and chemistry.
